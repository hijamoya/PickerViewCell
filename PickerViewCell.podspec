We provide two type of UITableViewCell:
1. DatePickerTableViewCell: when you make this cell becomeFirstResponder, it will invoke a UIDatePicker and then you can use the delegate function to get the value of the picker.
2.PickerTableViewCell: when you make this cell becomeFirstResponder, it will invoke a UIPickerView. You should specify your datasource and delegate.
